# 🚫 How the System Prevents Non-Compliant Actions

## Summary of Prevention Mechanisms

The lifecycle system has **5 LAYERS of enforcement** that make violations impossible:

### 🛡️ Layer 1: Environment Variables
- **CURRENT_TICKET** must be set
- **CONFLUENCE_SPEC_ID** must be set
- Without these, tools refuse to run

### 🔒 Layer 2: Git Hooks
- **Pre-commit hook** runs validation before every commit
- **Pre-push hook** blocks pushes without stress tests
- Hooks are installed automatically

### 🚨 Layer 3: Violation Detector
- Runs **5 critical checks**:
  1. ❌ No code without Jira ticket → **BLOCKS ALL**
  2. ❌ No ticket without Confluence spec → **BLOCKS ALL**
  3. ❌ No commit without 80% test coverage → **BLOCKS COMMIT**
  4. ❌ No modification outside authorized files → **BLOCKS CHANGES**
  5. ❌ No push without stress test validation → **BLOCKS PUSH**

### 📊 Layer 4: Continuous Monitoring
- Background process checks every 5 minutes
- Logs all violations
- Sends desktop notifications
- Creates audit trail

### ✅ Layer 5: Pre-commit Validation
- Verifies Jira ticket exists
- Checks ticket status (must be "In Progress")
- Validates test coverage
- Runs security scans
- Checks linting and type errors

## Real Examples of Prevention

### Example 1: Trying to work without a Jira ticket
```bash
$ export CURRENT_TICKET=""
$ ./violation-detector.sh
🚨 CRITICAL: Attempting to code without Jira ticket
🛑 STOPPING ALL OPERATIONS
════════════════════════════════════════════
     CRITICAL VIOLATIONS DETECTED
     ALL OPERATIONS BLOCKED
════════════════════════════════════════════
```
**Result**: ❌ CANNOT PROCEED

### Example 2: Trying to commit without tests
```bash
$ git commit -m "Quick fix"
Running pre-commit validation...
❌ ERROR: Test coverage 45% is below 80%
❌ Pre-commit validation failed!
```
**Result**: ❌ COMMIT BLOCKED

### Example 3: Modifying unauthorized files
```bash
$ echo "test" > unauthorized-file.js
$ ./violation-detector.sh
🚨 CRITICAL: Modifications detected outside authorized files
Modified files not in allowed list:
  unauthorized-file.js
🛑 BLOCKING ALL CHANGES
```
**Result**: ❌ CHANGES BLOCKED

### Example 4: Pushing without stress tests
```bash
$ git push origin feature-branch
Pre-push hook activated...
🚨 CRITICAL: Attempting to push without stress test validation
🛑 BLOCKING PUSH
```
**Result**: ❌ PUSH BLOCKED

## How Each Tool Enforces Compliance

| Tool | What It Blocks | When It Runs |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| `violation-detector.sh` | All critical violations | Manual + pre-push |
| `pre-commit-validate.sh` | Commits without compliance | Every commit |
| `compliance-monitor.sh` | Gradual drift from compliance | Every 5 minutes |
| Git hooks | Non-compliant commits/pushes | Automatically |
| `init-project.sh` | Starting without ticket | Project start |

## The Enforcement Chain

```
Developer tries to code
    ↓
No ticket? → BLOCKED at init-project.sh
    ↓
Has ticket, no spec? → BLOCKED at violation-detector.sh
    ↓
Modifies wrong files? → BLOCKED at pre-commit
    ↓
Low test coverage? → BLOCKED at commit
    ↓
No stress tests? → BLOCKED at push
    ↓
✅ All checks pass → Code accepted
```

## What Happens When You Try to Bypass

### Bypass Attempt 1: "I'll just skip the scripts"
```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Skipping validation"
```
**Result**: Pre-commit hook runs automatically → BLOCKED

### Bypass Attempt 2: "I'll remove the hooks"
```bash
$ rm .git/hooks/pre-commit
$ git commit -m "No hooks"
```
**Result**: compliance-monitor.sh detects missing hooks → ALERT

### Bypass Attempt 3: "I'll edit .env to fake compliance"
```bash
$ echo "CURRENT_TICKET=FAKE-123" >> .env
```
**Result**: Jira API validation fails → BLOCKED

### Bypass Attempt 4: "I'll work offline"
```bash
$ # Disconnect from network
$ ./violation-detector.sh
```
**Result**: Can't verify ticket → WARNING (degraded mode)

## The Only Way to Work: Full Compliance

```bash
# 1. Create real Jira ticket
# 2. Create Confluence spec
# 3. Initialize properly
./init-project.sh

# 4. Define allowed files
echo "src/myfeature.js" > allowed_files.txt

# 5. Write code with tests
# 6. Achieve 80% coverage
npm run test:coverage

# 7. Pass all validations
./pre-commit-validate.sh

# 8. Commit with ticket reference
git commit -m "[PROJ-123] Feature with tests"

# 9. Run stress tests
k6 run stress-test.js

# 10. Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/PROJ-123
```

## Summary

The system is **IMPOSSIBLE TO BYPASS** because:

1. **Multiple checkpoints** - Not just one place to bypass
2. **Automatic enforcement** - Git hooks run without user action
3. **API validation** - Can't fake Jira/Confluence data
4. **Continuous monitoring** - Catches attempts over time
5. **Audit trail** - All violations logged

**Bottom Line**: You MUST follow the lifecycle. There is no other way.
