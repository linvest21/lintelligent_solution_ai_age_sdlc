### Document Information
- **Created**: 2025-08-29
- **Author**: david.d.lin@linvest21.com
- **Jira Ticket**: AINV-707
- **Purpose**: Formal documentation of prompts used in the development lifecycle

---

## 1. Initial Project Context Prompt

### User Prompt #1:
```
what should I as next step?
```

### Formal Prompt Template:
```
Given the current project state with the mandatory CLAUDE.md workflow enforcement:
1. Identify the current phase of development
2. Check for any incomplete prerequisites
3. Provide the next mandatory step according to the workflow
4. List required actions in priority order
```

### Expected Response Pattern:
- Verification of environment setup
- Check for Jira ticket requirement
- Validate Confluence specification requirement
- Determine development mode (NEW/MODIFICATION)

---

## 2. Jira Ticket Assignment Prompt

### User Prompt #2:
```
jira ticker id: "AINV-532". Development type: Modification.
```

### Formal Prompt Template:
```
For Jira ticket [TICKET-ID] with development type [NEW|MODIFICATION]:
1. Validate ticket exists in Jira system
2. Verify ticket status is "In Progress" or "Development"
3. Confirm ticket is assigned to current user
4. Fetch linked Confluence specification
5. If MODIFICATION: List authorized files for changes
6. Create pre-modification snapshot if applicable
```

### Validation Checklist:
- [ ] Ticket exists in Jira
- [ ] Status is appropriate for development
- [ ] Assignee matches current user
- [ ] Confluence spec is linked
- [ ] Authorized files are defined

---

## 3. Ticket Reassignment Prompt

### User Prompt #3:
```
jira ticker id: "AINV-707". Development type: Modification.
```

### Formal Prompt Template:
```
When ticket validation fails, execute fallback workflow:
1. Identify validation failures
2. Provide corrective actions needed
3. List prerequisites that must be met
4. Suggest alternative tickets if applicable
5. Document the validation failure reason
```

---

## 4. Jira Ticket Management Prompt

### User Prompt #4:
```
Pls assign AINV-707 to me, and change status to "In progress" first, and tell me next step?
```

### Formal Prompt Template:
```
Execute Jira ticket management operations:
1. Assign ticket [TICKET-ID] to user [EMAIL]
   - Get user account ID from email
   - Execute assignment API call
2. Update ticket status to "In Progress"
   - Get available transitions
   - Execute status transition
3. Verify all changes were successful
4. Provide next steps in the workflow
```

### API Operations Required:
```bash
# Get user account ID
curl -u ${JIRA_EMAIL}:${JIRA_API_TOKEN} \
  -X GET \
  "https://${JIRA_URL}/rest/api/2/user/search?query=${USER_EMAIL}"

# Assign ticket
curl -u ${JIRA_EMAIL}:${JIRA_API_TOKEN} \
  -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fields":{"assignee":{"accountId":"[ACCOUNT_ID]"}}}' \
  "https://${JIRA_URL}/rest/api/2/issue/${TICKET_ID}"

# Update status
curl -u ${JIRA_EMAIL}:${JIRA_API_TOKEN} \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"transition":{"id":"[TRANSITION_ID]"}}' \
  "https://${JIRA_URL}/rest/api/2/issue/${TICKET_ID}/transitions"
```

## 5. Specification Upload Prompt

### User Prompt #5:
```
pls upload the spec doc named "AMB_FIX_HALLUCINATION_SPEC.MD" in "doc" directory.
```

### Formal Prompt Template:
```
Upload specification document to designated location:
1. Locate source document at [SOURCE_PATH]
2. Determine target location ([LOCAL_DIR|CONFLUENCE])
3. If local: Move/copy to specified directory
4. If Confluence: Create page with proper hierarchy
5. Maintain naming convention as specified
6. Verify upload success
```

### File Operations:
```bash
# Local file movement
mv [SOURCE_PATH] [DEST_DIR]/[FILENAME]

# Confluence upload
./upload_to_confluence.sh [SPEC_FILE]
```

---

## 6. Confluence Directory Structure Prompt

### User Prompt #6:
```
where is the spec in confluence's directory tree structure?
```

### Formal Prompt Template:
```
Query and report Confluence documentation location:

2. Identify relevant space for documentation type
3. Check for existing directory/page structure
4. Create missing directories if authorized
5. Upload documentation to correct location
6. Report full hierarchical path

# Get page hierarchy
curl -u ${CONFLUENCE_EMAIL}:${CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN} \
  -X GET \
  "${CONFLUENCE_URL}/rest/api/content?spaceKey=[SPACE_KEY]&type=page"
```

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### 1. Clarity and Specificity
- Always include ticket ID in prompts
- Specify development type explicitly
- Define target locations clearly
- Use exact filenames and paths

### 2. Validation Requirements
- Request confirmation of prerequisites
- Ask for validation before proceeding
- Require explicit success/failure reporting
- Include rollback instructions

### 3. Traceability
- Reference Jira tickets in all operations
- Link Confluence pages to tickets
- Maintain audit trail of changes
- Document decision rationale

### 4. Error Handling
- Anticipate common failure modes
- Provide clear error messages
- Include recovery procedures
- Document workarounds

## Example Composite Prompt

### Complete Development Cycle Prompt:
```
For Jira ticket AINV-XXX:
1. Validate ticket and assign to me if needed
2. Update status to "In Progress"
3. Create/verify Confluence specification at path: /Technology/AI/[TICKET-ID]
4. List authorized files for modification
5. Create pre-modification snapshot
6. Implement solution per specification
7. Generate tests with 80% minimum coverage
8. Run all validation checks
9. Generate and upload development report
10. Update Jira with completion status

Report each step's status and stop on any failure.
```

## Command Shortcuts Reference

### Quick Commands:
```bash
# Validate ticket
./jira-confluence-helper.sh validate [TICKET-ID]

# Assign and start ticket
./jira-confluence-helper.sh assign [TICKET-ID] [EMAIL]
